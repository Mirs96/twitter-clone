# React Frontend (Converted from Angular)

This project is a React application built with Vite and TypeScript, converted from an original Angular project.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port specified by Vite). The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.
